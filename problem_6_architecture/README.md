# Scoreboard API Module Specification

## 1. Overview
This document specifies the API module responsible for managing and updating the scoreboard on our website. The scoreboard displays the top 10 users with the highest scores and must support real-time updates while ensuring security against unauthorized score modifications.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Features
1. **Fetch Top 10 Scores**: API should provide an endpoint to retrieve the top 10 user scores.
2. **Update Score**: When a user completes an action, their score should be updated in the system.
3. **Real-time Updates**: The scoreboard should be updated in real-time for all users viewing it.
4. **Security**: Prevent unauthorized score modifications by implementing security mechanisms.

### 2.2 API Endpoints

#### 2.2.1 Get Top 10 Scores
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/scores/top`
- **Description:** Retrieves the top 10 scores from the database.
- **Response:**
  ```json
  [
    {"user": "User1", "score": 1200},
    {"user": "User2", "score": 1150},
    ...
  ]
  ```

#### 2.2.2 Update User Score
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/scores/update`
- **Description:** Updates the score of a user after an action.
- **Request:**
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "score_delta": 50,
    "auth_token": "valid-jwt-token"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  { "message": "Score updated successfully." }
  ```
- **Security Measures:**
  - Use JWT authentication to validate the user.
  - Rate limiting to prevent spamming score updates.
  - Store score updates securely and validate changes on the backend.

## 3. Execution Flow Diagram
A diagram illustrating the execution flow is attached as `scoreboard_diagram.drawio`.

## 4. Security Considerations
1. **JWT Authentication:** Only authenticated users can update their scores.
2. **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse by limiting update requests per user per minute.
3. **Server-side Validation:** Ensure that scores are increased in a controlled manner and prevent direct database manipulation.

## 5. Additional Comments for Improvement
- Consider using WebSockets to push real-time updates to all users viewing the scoreboard.
- Implement a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) to optimize frequent leaderboard queries.
- Introduce an audit log to track score modifications for security monitoring.
