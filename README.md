# 📌 Code Challenge Interview

📂 I have created separate folders for your code challenge problem tests.

🚀 The **Backend** source code is located in `problem_5_crud_server`.

### 🔧 How to Run the Source Code
1. **Navigate to the** `problem_5_crud_server` **directory from the root of the repository:**
   ```sh
   cd problem_5_crud_server
   ```

2. **Check the separate README.md file inside the** `problem_5_crud_server` **directory for detailed instructions on running the source.**

⚠️ Please do not skip this step.
